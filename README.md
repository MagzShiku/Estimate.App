# About EstiMate
This is a service that allows users to make estimates of their envisioned construction projects easily. The app collects user input on the preferences of the house and creates an estimated cost of the same. Allowing the user to know if the project is feasible or not.


# Stage 1 of development.
  # UX/UI Development
Designing the web application begins with understanding user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) – including how they are related and how they each impact the design choices in this stage of web app development.

User Interface (UI) is concerned with the look of the web app, dealing with design questions such as colors, fonts, placement, and overall design. UI design focuses on developing a UI that is aesthetically pleasing for the user.

User Experience (UX) manages how a customer interacts with the app by understanding what a user wants and feels. UX design is open-ended, asking at every stage what a user may want, need, and feel – and how to feel better and reduce friction in the experience. UX design elements include being useful, desirable, accessible, credible, findable, usable, and valuable.

We are using HTML, CSS, and JS.

# Stage 2 of Development
  # Mapping Out the User Journey
The user journey map visualizes the user flow through the web app over time. It tells the story of the user’s experience and puts the customer front and center in thinking. By mapping each step of the user (or customer) journey, it is easier to understand the motivations and needs. It challenges users' experience – and how better UX design can overcome these stumbling blocks.

# Stage 3 of Development
  # Wireframe the app
Wireframes are digital, simplified visual concepts of the app. They lay out the structure, hierarchy, and relationship between the elements that make up the product. Think of the wireframe as the “draft” or “plans” for the app, both the front and the back end of how the mobile app will look and how it will work.

# Stage 4 of development
  # MAke the app Clickable
Adding additional interactivity to the produced wireframes will allow the resulting prototype to appear and behave like the actual web app. This prototype will be seen and experienced with interactivity and enhanced UX elements that simulate the user experience, allowing for valuable feedback on functionality, design, and user experience before the entire development takes place.

# Stage 5 of Development
  # Development Stage
After design and validation comes development – the stage where more significant technical decisions are made about the frameworks and technologies that will support the app and the actual coding of the web app.

# Stage 6 of Development
  # The Tech Stack
A tech stack combines technology services, frameworks, and languages that make up the back end (how it works) and the front end (how it looks).

  - The front end (client-side) contains all the elements that go into the visual representation, including using three programming languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - The back-end (server-side) refers to everything that lives on the server, the workings or backbone of the web app. Back-end technologies include:
       - Framework – Libraries and general functionalities that can be assembled or built upon to assist the development
       - Server-side languages – Python, PHP, Ruby, C#, C++, GO, Java, Perl
       - Database – MongoDB, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server
       - Web server – Apache, Nginx, IIS
       - Operating system – Windows, MacOS, iOS, Linux, Android  
# Stage 7 of development
  # Database Architecture
Model – How data is stored in the database.
View – Displays the model data to the user / the visible components, such as an output or a GUI.
Controller – The central interface between the user and the system, helping to convert the output from the model to the view component.

# Stage 8 of development
  # Develop the front-end
