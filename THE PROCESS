2. I WANT THAT WHEN SONEONE SELECTS TYPOLOGY AND THE OTHER DROP DOWNS, THE INFORMATION IS CAPTURED AND POSTED IN THE NEXT PAGE
###   
To capture and post the information selected in a typology dropdown and other dropdowns on the next page, you will need to use a combination of HTML, JavaScript, and server-side programming.

Here's a general outline of the steps you can follow:

- Create an HTML form on the first page with the typology dropdown and other dropdowns you want to capture information from.
- Use JavaScript to capture the selected values from the dropdowns when the form is submitted. You can use the addEventListener method to listen for the form submission event and retrieve the selected values.
- Store the captured values in JavaScript variables or objects.
- Submit the form to the next page using either the action attribute of the form or JavaScript's window.location method.
- On the next page, retrieve the captured values from the server-side using the programming language of your choice (e.g., PHP, Python, etc.).
- Process the captured values on the server-side and use them as needed (e.g., store in a database, display on the page, etc.).
